# BookHub App

Our Project will be divided in three parts: Back End, Front End, and Documentation. 
Here you will find a directory for each part. <br><br>

## Version Control

Each part will have their own branch to maximize version control.<br>

The FrontEnd and BackEnd branches will be deployed separately using Heroku.<br>

<strong>CODE IN BOTH BRANCHES SHALL ALWAYS BE EXECUTABLE.</strong><br>

<strong>CODE IN MASTER BRANCH SHALL ALWAYS BE INTEGRATED.</strong><br><br>
